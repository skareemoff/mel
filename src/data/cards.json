Decide who goes first. Tap **Play.**\n> 2. The first person reads the question out loud and shares their answer with the rest.\n> 3. After their answer, the person choses who goes next and passes them phone.\n> 4. The next person swipes the card to reveal the next question, and the gameplay repeats itself.\n\n ###### **Pro Tip:** For deeper understanding and connection, ask the speaker follow up questions, especially about the points, that seem obvious to you. _\"What does X mean to you?\"_ can be quite revealing. ######",

Decide who goes first. Tap **Play.**\n> 2. Pick a question together, reading it out loud, and letting the child say if it is a good question first.\n> 3. Offer the child to answer it first, but be ready to answer it first yourself, if the child prefers that.\n> 4. After the child’s response, the grown up answers the same question to model sharing.\n> 5. If a **Challenge Card** appears, everyone does a fun action like drawing their answer, acting it out, or finding an object in the room related to the question.\n\n ###### **Pro Tip:** Keep it playful! Award stars for creative answers and completed challenges. ######",
