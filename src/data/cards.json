Decide who goes first. Tap **Play.**\n> 2. Pick a question together, reading it out loud, and letting the child say if it is a good question first.\n> 3. Offer the child to answer it first, but be ready to answer it first yourself, if the child prefers that.\n> 4. After the child’s response, the grown up answers the same question to model sharing.\n> 5. If a **Challenge Card** appears, everyone does a fun action like drawing their answer, acting it out, or finding an object in the room related to the question.\n\n ###### **Pro Tip:** Keep it playful! Award stars for creative answers and completed challenges. ######",
